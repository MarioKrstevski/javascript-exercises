1. getArrayItems

Write a JavaScript function to get the element of an array. Passing a parameter 'n' will return the first 'n' elements of the array. Passing a parameter 'first/last', will items from the beggining or the end (beginning is default)
[Advanced: Make the function flexible to be able to take the arguments in any order]

```
Test Data : 
console.log(get([7, 9, 0, -2])); 
console.log(get([],3));
console.log(get([7, 9, 0, -2],3));
console.log(get([7, 9, 0, -2],6));
console.log(get([7, 9, 0, -2],-3));
Expected Output : 
7
[] 
[7, 9, 0] 
[7, 9, 0, -2] 
[] 

Test Data : 
console.log(get([7, 9, 0, -2],1,last)); 
console.log(get([7, 9, 0, -2],3),last); 
console.log(get([7, 9, 0, -2],6),last);
Expected Output : 
-2 
[9, 0, -2] 
[7, 9, 0, -2]
```

2. separateEven

Write a JavaScript program which accept a number as input and insert dashes (-) between each two even numbers. 

Write a JavaScript function to get the first element of an array. Passing a parameter 'n' will return the first 'n' elements of the array.

```
For example if you accept 025468 the output should be 
Expected Output : 
0-254-6-8.
```


3. arraySort

Write two functions that would be extended on the array prototype, sortAsc() & sortDesc(), that would sort an array by ascending and descending respectfully, they should work both on number and string values

```
Sample array : var arr1 = [ 3, 8, 7, 6, 5, -4, 3, 2, 1 ];
                    arr1.sortAsc()
Sample Output : -4,-3,1,2,3,5,6,7,8
```


4. mostFrequentItem

```

Sample array : var arr1=[3, 'a', 'a', 'a', 2, 3, 'a', 3, 'a', 2, 4, 9, 3];
Sample Output : a ( 5 times ) 
```


5. mostFrequentWord

Write a JavaScript program to find the most frequent word in a sentance or paragraph. If there are multiple with the same occurence, return the first one.
